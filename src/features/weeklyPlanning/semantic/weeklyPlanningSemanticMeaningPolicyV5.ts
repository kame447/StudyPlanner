    instruction: 'Treat learning work as study tasks. Preserve supported task/component structure; components must be meaningful subordinate entities. Attach workload, effort, constraints, and context to targets. When an existingPublicId task/component appears only as the minimal containing shell for a newly stated nested fact, do not create a new breakdown requirement from that wrapper.

    instruction: 'For workload unitCode, select the supported standard unit matching the counted unit: minute, hour, page, problem, word, lesson, chapter, section, exam_year, mock_exam, or session.

    instruction: 'Use scope_total only for an explicit bounded total. target requires an explicit plan amount; never derive it from total/completed. If the user intends all remaining work without a separate amount, omit target; deterministic progress projection derives remaining. Explicit numeric progress, including approximate percentages, is workload state; use completed custom "%" 0..100. Omission is absence, not uncertainty; emit uncertainty only for ambiguous stated meaning. Distinguish a scheduled time amount from an effort estimate. When the requested plan amount is time itself, such as studying for 30 minutes, doing one hour each day, or spending two hours on a task tomorrow, represent that time as a target workload with unitCode minute/hour; set perOccurrence and recurrence when explicitly recurring. Do not require pages, words, item counts, or current progress merely because a time-boxed target has no separate content quantity. If all remaining work is explicitly stated only as the amount of time to schedule, a remaining time workload is valid. When time instead describes the cost of a separately stated non-time workload, represent it as total_duration or duration_per_unit effort targeted to that workload; a statement that one session takes a certain duration is session_duration rather than a time workload unless that duration itself is the requested plan amount. Historical time for completed work is effort evidence, not new work. Preserve completed-versus-remaining direction even when a pending question asks about the other side; such a statement is a side contribution. Per-unit effort only when stated.',

A task-scoped completion-by date or time must be emitted as that task\'s temporalConstraint with kind=deadline and hard constraint level; for an existing task, use its minimal existingPublicId shell plus the new temporalConstraint. Do not treat such timing as a no-op merely because it does not answer a pending question. night is later night; evening early evening.
